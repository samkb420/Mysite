	<h4>[~] DEVELOPMENT OF SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE IN THE FIELD OF COMPUTER SCIENCE</h4>

	<p>
		In this era technology is growing and becoming one of the most advanced thing global wide, <br>
		hence making human lives to be more easy.Computer science is one of the course that is leading <br>
		in the development of technology.Once you learn this course you can be able to develop softwares and develop <br>
		hardware , you can do many things such as network manager , do machine learning ,make games ,develop artificial inteligence <br>
		Apps , develop web application and many athers.In order to be productive you need to make wise decision in order to develop <br>
		someting .You need to choose language to learn,listing some of the most known language are : python,java,c, c++,c#,ruby,html,css,javascript<br>
		kotlin,swift,go and R.
	</p>
		<h4>[~] LEARNING CURVE</h4>
		<p>
		You need to learn some basic mathematics such as descrete math and linear algebra to understand the basic of computer science <br>
		you also need to learn some computer languages ,you need to learn from the simplest language to avoid disappointment ,practice is <br>
		is also needed to make you better.</p>
		<h4>[~]LEARNING RESOURCES</h4>
		<p>
		In this field how to get started is using online acadamies which are very rich in notes ,examples and video tutorials.By doing some quiz<br>
		and practicing will make you grow from a beginer to an advanced software engineer.Rasearch will help you get to get real life problem and be <br>
		to design algolithm to build application.Also group or a team can make good learning by giving each ather challanges and teaching ather any tricks<br>
